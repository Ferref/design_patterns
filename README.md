# Design Patterns Learning Order

## 1. Singleton
- Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

## 2. Factory Method
- Defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.

## 3. Builder
- Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations.

## 4. Prototype
- Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.

## 5. Adapter
- Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by converting the interface of a class into another interface that a client expects.

## 6. Decorator
- Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically and transparently, without affecting other objects.

## 7. Observer
- Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

## 8. Strategy
- Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. The strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.

## 9. Command
- Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.

## 10. Facade
- Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

## 11. Composite
- Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, allowing clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.

## 12. Template Method
- Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

## 13. Proxy
- Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

## 14. Chain of Responsibility
- Passes a request along a chain of handlers, where each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it on to the next handler.

## 15. State
- Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, making the object appear to change its class.

## 16. Memento
- Captures and externalizes an objectâ€™s internal state without violating encapsulation, so the object can be restored to this state later.

## 17. Iterator
- Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

## 18. Mediator
- Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly.

## 19. Visitor
- Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure, allowing you to define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.

## 20. Interpreter
- Defines a representation of the grammar of a language and an interpreter that uses this representation to interpret sentences in the language.
